	New classes for infinite integers (this is used for scores,
	which can be -infty, i.e. undefined). The new mechanism automatizes
	normalization of infinity using the type system and avoids wrong
	usage by the type system. Consequently, it is more flexible. It avoids

============================================================
=== 2011

Jan 2011
	Alignment in limited deviation to a reference alignment
	program deviation computes deviation of alignment to reference
	Deactivate max-diff-aln for --probabilistic/locarna_p
	(Version 1.6)

Feb 2011
	Restructure code
	library libLocARNA is generated and is used as library by executables

	Fix name normalization bug in mlocarna.in
	(Version 1.6.1)
Mar 2011
	Doxygen compiles without warning and produces useful documentation
	of the library

	Vienna RNA library is now required for compilation and will be linked

	Locarna accepts clustal files as input and then computes base pair
	probabilities via pf_fold of the Vienna RNA lib. Currently this is
	limited to single sequence clustal files.
	Implement reading of mfasta files (still switched off).

Apr 2011
	Implement several alignment comparison measures (and use in locarna_deviation) (EXPERIMENTAL)

	Make linking to Vienna librna configurable, default=off! Activate
	by calling ./configure with --enable-librna.

	New strategy for consensus dot plot generation: employ RNAalifold
	-p.  Enable via mlocarna's option --alifold-consensus-dp Note: the
	default consensus dot plot computation seems to be flawed! The new
	tool pp2dot allows to visualize consensus dot plots (by converting
	pp to Vienna-like dot plot postscript files) and should help to
	improve the default strategy (otherwise we are going to replace
	it!)

	mlocarna accepts via --tree-file a super-tree as guide tree and
	automatically projects to the taxa in the input.

	Allow quotation in newick trees (using Text::ParseWords)
	and use quotations when generating newick trees

May 2011
	Fix a problem with compiling on case-insensitive file systems (generate 	locarna.bin instead of locarna executable in src, rename at install)

	add alifold-consensus-dp option for mlocarna

Aug 2011: Add code for 'locarna_X'

Sep 2011: Adding Exparna-P code for "in loop" probabilities

Oct 2011: pre-release 1.6.2

Nov 2011:
	Add mlocarna options (pw-aligner and pw-aligner-p) to run
	specified binaries in place of locarna and locarna_p. This can be
	used to plug in compatible programs like carna

	Bug fix; compilation without linking libRNA was broken.
	release (1.6.2)

Dec 2011
	Bug-fixes: treefile regexp, LARGE_PF name clash mit Vienna package
	(1.6.2.1)
	add script to translate to normalized names for mlocarna

	Add options pw-aligner-options and pw-aligner-p-options, to mlocarna to pass option strings to the pairwise
	aligner.  This is useful in combination with specifying
	non-standard pairwise alignment programs.

	Support generation of pp files from dp2.ps and dp.ps files when
	skipping dot plot computation with --skip-pp (keep name for
	legacy).  This allows the combine user-defined dotplots with
	anchor constraints from the mfasta input file.

	Support fixed structures (with pseudoknots) in the fasta input
	of mlocarna as structure constraint string with tag #FS
	All base pairs in the fix structure receive a probability of 1.
	(1.6.2.2)

============================================================
=== 2010

Jan 2010
	new tool Utils/reliability-profile.pl generates nice
	profile plots from mlocarna --probabilistic output directories

	(locarna-1.5a)

Mar 2010
	Add normalized local alignment, proof of concept
	(locarna-1.5.1)
	Combine normalized alignment and kbest
	Introduce option better to enumerate suboptimal solution
	better than given threshold
	--kbest and --better can be used together
	(locarna-1.5.2)
	Fix build in separate build directory

May 2010
	Introduce new representation of fasta data
	Major restructuring/refactorization of mlocarna.in and MLocarna.pm
	Move many functions of mlocarna.in to packages and
	introduce several new packages to group functions thematically
	(locarna-1.5.3)

	Resolve a bug that made LocARNA handle Ts as unknown
	characters. LocARNA now automatically transforms Ts to Us in input
	sequences. The bug did not affect input sequences without Ts. For
	matchs involving Ts, LocARNA wrongly used an ad-hoc score instead
	of the ribosum score for matches involving 'U', as one would
	expect.

Oct 2010
	Add EdgeController: adds feature to constrain (max-diff-match)
	alignment relative to a given alignment.  Change handling of
	max-diff-match in case of unequal length: instead of relaxing
	constraint, change constraint to |i*(lenB/lenA)-j|<=max-diff
	Add multiple alignment class to support construction of EdgeController.

Nov 2010
	Change Copyright to GPL v2 and update README

	rename max-diff-match to max-diff heuristic.

	replace EdgeController by TraceController use the max-diff delta
	( TraceController ) to restrict alignment of paired and unpaired
	positions (not only ends of arcs) in Aligner. Semantics is given by
	restriction of alignment cuts/matrix cells!

============================================================
=== 2009

Jan 2009 (v1.42)
	iterative alignment using SCI as optimization criterion

Feb 2009 (v1.4.4alpha)
	cleanup mlocarna code
	cleanup mlocarna output (inclusive output modes -v, --moreverbose)
	improve reliability computation
	multi-threaded mlocarna, new option --cpus <n>: use n threads
	more structure for mlocarna output to file system (distribute
	files to subdirs)
	introduce --pf-scale parameter to locarna_p and mlocarna

	precompute exp base match similarity and gap cost for partition
	function => significant speed up of locarna_p
	change handling of max_diff: guarantee at least |lenA-lenB|
        improve outside algorithm in locarna_p (reduce sizes of Mrev-matrices)
	=> with prior optimization massive speedup of locarna_p

	add probability filtering after cbt
	further improvement of outside (cheaper computation of certain
	Mprime entries)
	iteration with reliable structure as constraints
	(option --it-reliable-structure)

	support for non-threaded perl

Mar 2009
	fix some problems with the option parsing
	(e.g. now -p=0.1 is correct and -p=a throws an error)
	fix bug in initialization for structure locality
	change semantics of constraints in the context of locality:
	anchor constraints (i,j) now enforce that edge (i,j) is part
	of the local alignment (for sequence and structure locality)
Apr 2009
	add missing options to mlocarna, fix bug in locarnate (thanks to Wolfgang)
	fix bug with sharing/threads in mlocarna (v1.4.6)
	locarna_p computes probabilities for matching fragments
May 2009
	clean manpage of mlocarna
Jun 2009
	offer large data type "long double" for partition function
	computation.  this is available when configuring through option
	--enable-large-pf. Use this in case of long alignments, where the
	partition function exceeds the range of type "double". Although
	--pf-scale sometimes provides a workaround, for multiple alignment
	of large sequences it is often the only viable choice.

Jul 2009
	add free endgaps via option --free-endgaps "----", for locarna
	gaps at all for ends can be allowed for free independently.
	For mlocarna, --free-endgaps will allow free end gaps at any end.

Sep 2009
	fixed serious bugs concerning stacking: due to these bugs,
	mlocarna did not profit from stacking and locarna could get wrong
	results with stacking turned on.

	Change base pair filtering by probability for stacking: ignore
	stacking probability, filter only by base pair probability.

	(locarna-1.4.9alpha)

============================================================
=== 2008
Feb 2008
	remove bug in anchor constraints
	Ribosum-85-60 compiled in
	changed default parameters to something reasonable

Mar 2008
	remove bug in rna_data.cc reading dp.ps, v 1.2.4

Jun 2008
	change char * to std::string in options module
	(the g++-compiler does not like it anymore :))

Jul 2008
	integrate locarnate - a tool for multiple alignment
	that uses locarna in combination with tcoffee
	(Version 1.3)

Aug 2008
	partition function version of locarna (locarna_p)
	experimental support for multiple alignment using
	  basematch probabilities and probabilistic
	  consistency transformation
        (Version 1.3.2)

	mlocarna can write basematch probabilities for plotting
	plotting of basematch probs (Utils/plot-bmprobs)

	mlocarna now correctly accepts input trees in newick-format that
	are terminated by ";". However, it does not enforce the ";"-termination
	mlocarna now writes the result.tree in ";"-terminated newick-format

	use rounding (instead of truncate) in scoring module, when
	converting from double to score_t. This fixes some inconsistency
	between 32/64bit and is the correct thing to do anyway

Oct 2008
	improve speed up gained from using anchor constraints

Nov 2008 (v1.4)
	add probabilistic scoring with consistency transformation
	with structural scoring in progressive alignment steps

	change options of mlocarna for probabilistic/mea-type alignment


============================================================
=== 2007
Sept 2007 (1.0alpha)
	refactoring; new classes Scoring, RnaData, ...
	preparations for better scoring:
	reading Ribosum-Data, new class Ribosum
	computing match probabilities in sequence alignment (Gotoh):
	   	Implemented methods: pairHMM, partition function, local pf
		new class MatchProbs
	improve option parser: introduce sections and section hiding
	integrate new scoring scheme: maximum expected accuracy
	significant speed-up due to re-organization of the recursion
	equations:
	        redefine D to already contain the score contribution of
		the arcmatch. This reduces these computations by orders of
		magnitude!

Nov 2007
	add constraints to pairwise and multiple alignment. This means
	for locarna: integrate anchor constraints
	for mlocarna: read and pass structure constraints to RNAfold -p,
	              read and pass sequence constraints to locarna
        The pp-format is redefined in order to pass constraint information from
	mlocarna to locarna.
	New class for representing and calculating with infinite scores
	changed default sequ-local=on to off
	increased min_prob in mlocarna.pl

	bug fix in computation of consensus probs

	avoid writing to global /tmp directory (v_1_2_2a)
	avoid potential file name conflicts in mlocarna
	accept duplicate (or not prefix unique) names in mfasta input


============================================================
=== 2006

Jan 2006: add support for aligning alignments
	(used for multiple progressive alignment)

Aug 2006: lessen memory consumption of locarna.
	In particular important in case of
	scanning (target against genome)

	option --kbest
	option --max-diff-am
	option --ungappedA
	option --local-output
	handling of nucleotide-symbol N for unknown in input


Oct 2006: add support for stacking alignment, not finished
