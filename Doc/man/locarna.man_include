[>DESCRIPTION]

locarna is the pairwise alignment tool of the LocARNA package, which
performs fast simultaneous folding and alignment based on two RNA
sequences (or alignments). 

.SS Input

.PP
Input consists of two sequences or alignments, which are specified in
fasta, clustal, stockholm, or LocARNA pp format.  Optionally,
structure and anchor constraints can be specified in the input files.
If alignments are given in the input, they are aligned without
revising the gap structure within the given alignments. Unless
specified, base pair probabilities of the input sequences or
alignments are predicted using the ViennaRNA package.  Optionally,
base pair probability information can be passed for one or both input
sequences (or alignments) using the input formats LocARNA PP 2.0 or
ViennaRNA postscript dotplot format.

.SS Constraints

.PP
Anchor and structure constraints can be specified in the input
files. Anchor constraints for sequences (alignments) are defined by
assigning names to sequence positions (alignment columns),
respectively. The exact semantics is either strict or relaxed
(controled by --relaxed-anchors). In strict semantics, anchor names
have to be sorted lexicographically in the input as well as in the
result alignment (in the sense that result columns receive inherit the
name from one or both input positions, where conflicts are
disallowed). In relaxed semantics, anchors of the same name are forced
into the same alignment column. The actual syntax of the constraint
specification depends on the file format (see Constraint Examples
below).

.SS Output

.PP
The final pairwise alignment is reported in standard and/or variants of the
clustal and stockholm format, as well as LocARNA's own pp format.

[DISCLAIMERS]

For many purposes, it is more convenient to use the multiple alignment
tool mlocarna (even for pairwise alignment). However, certain tasks
--like aligning two specific alignments-- are supported only by the
pairwise tool or can be better controlled. Note that the performance
of locarna (as well as basically all tools in the LocARNA package) is
often significantly improved by the use of suitable
application-specific options, deviating from the default
settings. 

.PP
Locarna's alignments are optimal -- it's the parameters,
stupid ;).

[EXAMPLES]

In the simplest case, the tool is called with two sequences in fasta
format or two alignments in multiple fasta, clustal or stockholm format like

  locarna file1.fa file2.fa 

or

   locarna file1.aln file2.aln

Note that input formats can be mixed like in

  locarna file1.aln file2.stk


.SS Constraint Examples

.PP
Anchor and structure constraints can be specified in extended versions
of the Clustal format, in the LocARNA PP 2.0 format, as well as in
Stockholm format. Currently, the pairwise alignment tools of the
package do not support constraints in fasta-like input. Here is an
example of constraints in Clustal format:

.nf
.ft CW
CLUSTAL W

vhuU            AGCUCACAACCGAACCCAUUUGGGAGGUUGUGAGCU
fruA            CC-UCGAGGG-GAACCCGAAA-GGGACCCGAGA-GG
#S              (<<<<<<<<<......xxxx...............)
#A1             .............AAABB..................
#A2             .............12312..................
.ft
.fi

The syntax (and semantic) of structure constraint strings (prefixed by
#S) is the one of RNAfold of the ViennaRNA package. Moreover, fixed
structures prefixed by #FS are accepted; fixed structures can contain
pseudoknots encodes by different bracket symbols.

Anchors are specified by naming columns, where names can consist of
several places, in the example each name consists of two characters,
such that the names are A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 for the respective columns.

.PP
Constraints in PP format are specified in the same way; however, in
Stockholm format we use different prefixes, such that the example would look like

.nf
.ft CW
# STOCKHOLM 1.0

vhuU            AGCUCACAACCGAACCCAUUUGGGAGGUUGUGAGCU
fruA            CC-UCGAGGG-GAACCCGAAA-GGGACCCGAGA-GG
#=GC cS         (<<<<<<<<<......xxxx...............)
#=GC cA1        .............AAABB..................
#=GC cA2        .............12312..................
.ft
.fi

The prefix for fixed structures is '#=GC cFS'.
